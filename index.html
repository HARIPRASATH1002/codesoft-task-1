        <p>
          Indian Motorcycle (or Indian) is an American brand of motorcycles 
          owned and produced by American automotive manufacturer.Originally 
          produced from 1901 to 1953 in Springfield, Massachusetts, United States, 
          Hendee Manufacturing Company initially produced the motorcycles, but
          the name was changed to the Indian Motocycle Company in 1923.In 2011,
          Polaris Industries purchased the Indian motorcycle marque,moved operations
          from North Carolina merging them into their existing facilities in Minnesota
           and Iowa.
        </p>
        <p>Since August 2013, Polaris has designed, engineered, and manufactured many lines of motorcycles
           under the Indian Motorcycle brand reflecting Indian's traditional styling.
          The Indian Motorcycle factory team took the first three places in the 1911 
          Isle of Man Tourist Trophy. During the 1910s, Indian Motorcycle became the largest manufacturer 
          of motorcycles in the world. Indian Motocycleâ€™s most popular models were the Scout, made from 
          1920 to 1946, and the Chief,made from 1922 until 1953, when the Indian Motorcycle made Manufacturing 
          Company was declared bankrupt. Various organizations tried to perpetuate the Indian Motorcycle
           brand name in subsequent years, with limited success.
          
        
        </p>
        <p>
          The "Indian Motocycle Co." was founded as the Hendee Manufacturing Company by George M. Hendee in 
          1897 to manufacture bicycles. These were initially badged as "Silver King" and "Silver Queen"
           brands but the name "American Indian", quickly shortened to just "Indian", was adopted by Hendee
           from 1898 onwards because it gave better product recognition in export markets.
